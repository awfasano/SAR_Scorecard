## üìò Purpose

This repo is designed to provide **comprehensive indicator coverage** across all eight South Asia Region (SAR) countries, spanning both national (`admin0`) and subnational (`admin1`) levels. Each location‚Äìindicator combination includes up to two data points: one for the **most recent value** and one for the **previous value**.

## üìä Database Structure

### ‚úîÔ∏è Admin Unit Coverage

The database currently accounts for the following number of administrative level 1 (admin1) regions:

| Country | Admin1 Units |
|---------|--------------|
| AFG     | 34           |
| BGD     | 8            |
| BTN     | 20           |
| IND     | 36           |
| LKA     | 9            |
| MDV     | 20           |
| NPL     | 7            |
| PAK     | 7            |
| **Total** | **141**     |

In addition to subnational data, national-level data (admin0) is also included for each country.

### üßÆ Data Shape Expectation

Assuming **30 indicators** and **2 measurement types** (recent and previous), the expected row count is:

- **Admin0 Level**: 8 countries √ó 30 indicators √ó 2 = **480 rows**
- **Admin1 Level**: 141 units √ó 30 indicators √ó 2 = **8,460 rows**

**Total expected rows: ~8,940**  
*(Note: actual number may differ depending on available indicators and missing values)*

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Additions

- Support for **level2** (district-level) granularity as data becomes available.
