## üìò Purpose

This database is designed to provide **comprehensive indicator coverage** across all eight South Asia Region (SAR) countries, spanning both national (`admin0`) and subnational (`admin1`) levels. Each location-indicator combination includes up to two data points: one for the **most recent value** and one for the **previous value**.

## üìä Database Structure

### ‚úîÔ∏è Admin Unit Coverage

The database currently accounts for the following number of administrative level 1 (admin1) regions:

| Country | Admin1 Units |
|---------|--------------|
| AFG     | 34           |
| BGD     | 8            |
| BTN     | 20           |
| IND     | 36           |
| LKA     | 9            |
| MDV     | 20           |
| NPL     | 7            |
| PAK     | 7            |
| **Total** | **141**     |

In addition to subnational data, national-level data (admin0) is also included for each country.

## üóÇÔ∏è Variable Descriptions

| Variable Name        | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `country_wb`         | ISO3 country code (e.g., `AFG` for Afghanistan). |
| `level0_code`        | Code for the top-level country or region. |
| `level0_name`        | Name of the top-level entity (e.g., Afghanistan). |
| `level1_code`        | Code for first-level admin unit (e.g., province/state). |
| `level1_name`        | Name of the first-level administrative unit. |
| `level2_code`        | Code for second-level admin unit (optional). |
| `level2_name`        | Name of the second-level admin unit (optional). |
| `disputed`           | Flag for disputed territory (`ND` = Not Disputed / No Data). |
| `outcome_area`       | Development theme or outcome area (e.g., Vision, People, Planet). |
| `scorecard_side`     | High-level pillar the indicator supports (e.g., Client Context). |
| `indicator`          | Short name/code of the indicator. |
| `indicator_label`    | Full label or description of the indicator. |
| `value`              | Measured value (may be blank if not available). |
| `year`               | Year of the observation. |
| `measurement_type`   | Indicates if value is `recent`, `previous`, or other metadata. |

### üßÆ Data Shape Expectation

Assuming **30 indicators** and **2 measurement types** (recent and previous), the expected row count is:

- **Admin0 Level**: 8 countries √ó 30 indicators √ó 2 = **480 rows**
- **Admin1 Level**: 141 units √ó 30 indicators √ó 2 = **8,460 rows**

**Total expected rows: ~8,940**  
*(Note: actual number may differ depending on available indicators and missing values)*

## üìå Notes on Indicators and Naming

- All indicators from the **Country Scorecard (CSC)** should be represented at the national level, even when subnational data is unavailable.
- Indicators must be included under **each outcome area**, even if repeated. This ensures filtering by any outcome area is complete.
- For user clarity, indicator names should match those shown on the CSC site as closely as possible (e.g., prefer "Greenhouse Gas Emissions" over just "GHG Emissions").
- Some indicators originally meant for aggregates (e.g., "countries with high inequality") are replaced with more granular equivalents like the **Gini coefficient** for country-level analysis.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Additions

- Support for **level2** (district-level) granularity as data becomes available.
- Updates for new or revised indicators based on CSC expansion.
- Improvements to metadata fields including `source`, `unit`, and `notes`.
